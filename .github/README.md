## Overview

**opencart-3-fr** is a French language pack for the ecommerce platform [OpenCart](http://www.opencart.com/) (from version 3.0.2.0).

This pack brings together translated files for a French localization of the administration interface (_backend_) as well as the online store (_frontend_).

### Background

This project succeeds to [**opencart-2-fr**](https://github.com/gizmecano/opencart-2-fr/), developed and maintained from 2015 to 2018, but most of the translations have been completely reworked from scratch.

### Principles

This language pack has been developed with some basic principles in mind:

- **idiomatic translations**: translation strings did not have been automatically generated, but by understanding the context in order to draft an appropriate formulation
- **native `utf-8` support**: accented characters and most common typographic signs use standard `utf-8` encoding
- **proper typographics usages**: typographic rules and practices used in the French language redaction (spaces and punctuation marks in particular) are respected
- **understated technical jargon**: technical references are translated in the most understandable manner possible
- **gender-neutral formulations**: in order to be as inclusive as possible, translations preferably use language that does not use the gender of users or visitors
